                        Listening to music and watching music videos is one of my hobbies. 
                        I really like the way kpop shoots mv. My dream is to be a singer, 
                        so I want to shoot my own mv. In the course of still & moving image, 
                        I cover this mv as my final project.

                        I worked with a fellow director at tisch. 
                        I was the scenarist director, an actor, video editor, stylists and makeup artistsin this video.
                         We shot the video over three days in six locations in New York: Central Park,
                          Times Square, dumbo, the Barbie pop-up, and more. As a director, I need to write the story, 
                          draw the storyboards and so on. As an actor, I need to learn this dance and interpret the 
                          emotions of the character.

                        I am very happy and satisfied with this shooting. 
                        Even though the final film still has a lot of areas that can be improved, 
                        such as dance, editing techniques and so on. But this is my first attempt at directing 
                        and acting in a music video. It allowed me to see my potential and realize part of my dream. 
                        I hope I will have more opportunities to contact the entertainment industry and do more shooting in the future.
