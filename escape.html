                        I really like to play escape rooms and horror games, and solving puzzles in the escape room 
                        is a very fulfilling thing for me. I hope to bring that sense of achievement to others. 
                        Adding scary elements makes it more immersive. Sometimes people don't have the opportunity 
                        to play Escape Room offline, so I created this online horror type escape room.

                        I used p5js as a tool, which mainly uses the JavaScript language. 
                        In the work, I added horror music and sound effects to enhance the atmosphere. 
                        Considering the different age groups of players, the puzzles in this game are not difficult. 
                        All the puzzles are guided by the previous step, making the game easy to understand. 
        
                        The first scene will be warm to contrast with the second scene. 
                        The music used is also of the suspense type. The second scene is in the horror genre and fits the theme 
                        of a horror game. The change of music and scene adds a sense of urgency and gives the game more layers.
