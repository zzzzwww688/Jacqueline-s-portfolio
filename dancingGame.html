                        I’m a dancer. I like dancing very much. I wanted to create a dance game that we can play anytime and anywhere. 
                        This project is a replica of a famous dance game - just dance. I hope I can complete this project with
                         what I have learned.

                        Since I was using a video of this game's dance sequence, 
                        I needed to capture the player's movements through the camera. 
                        The innovation in this project is that I added motion recognition. 
                        The game leverages skeleton-based motion recognition to detect and analyze player movements. 
                        This technology allows the  game to compare the player’s physical dance moves against the required dance prompts,
                          creating a more immersive and interactive experience.

                    <h4>Project Overview</h4>
                    <p>
                        <strong>Summary:</strong> As a passionate dancer, I wanted to create a dance game that anyone can play anytime and anywhere. This project replicates the popular dance game Just Dance using innovative technology to enhance interactivity and performance tracking.

                    <p>
                        <strong>Objective:</strong> To build a fun, immersive dance game that utilizes motion recognition to track and evaluate players’ movements in real time.

                <h4>Problem Statement or Inspiration</h4>
                <p>
                    Dance is a universal language of self-expression, yet structured dance activities often require specific environments or equipment. Inspired by Just Dance, I aimed to make dance more accessible and interactive by combining technology and creativity using p5.js.

                <h4> Features and Technology</h4>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Video Integration:</strong> The game includes videos from Just Dance to provide dance sequences for players to follow.</li>
                    <li><strong>Motion Recognition:</strong> Leveraging p5.js with motion-tracking libraries (e.g., PoseNet), the game detects and evaluates player movements using a webcam. Skeleton-based tracking compares the player’s motions to predefined dance prompts, ensuring accurate feedback.</li>
                    <li><strong>Immersive Gameplay:</strong> Real-time movement analysis and visual feedback make the experience engaging and educational.</li>
                </ul>

            <section class="tools-methodology">
                <h4>Tools and Methodology</h4>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Tools Used:</strong> p5.js for motion recognition, interactive visuals, and game logic; PoseNet (via p5.js) for skeleton tracking; HTML/CSS for creating a user-friendly interface; and video editing tools to prepare dance videos.</li>
                    <li><strong>Development Process:</strong> Used PoseNet to extract keypoints for skeleton tracking in p5.js, built an interactive interface that overlays real-time feedback on top of the dance video, and designed algorithms to compare player movements with reference movements in the video.</li>
                </ul>
